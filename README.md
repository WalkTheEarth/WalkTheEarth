# WalkTheEarth 

Hi, I'm WalkTheEarth, a developer with a passion for creating unique command-line tools and fun demos. 

I enjoy exploring different programming languages and turning data into exciting experiences. My projects include: 

- **PyQuake-cli**: Shake things up (literally!) with this CLI tool that visualizes USGS earthquake data. 
- **Ratlocker**: Experience the thrill (and harmless scare) of ransomware with this unique demo. 
- **Blahaj**: A fun name generator for Blahaj plushies, because every Blahaj needs a unique identity! 
- **EarthquakeDataCenters**: Dive deep into global earthquake data and explore the world's most active regions. 
- **Website**: Visit my website to discover more of my projects and adventures in coding. 

Feel free to explore my repository, and don't hesitate to reach out! I love connecting with fellow developers and enthusiasts.
